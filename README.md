# Cookie Thief 0.1 

Send it your cookies. 

It will show them to you. 

## On the real

This is the start of a Cookie Harvesting application. I made it as an excuse to play around with jQuery and AJAX. 

The idea is that you can send it a cookie in any format, be it via a POST or GET request and it will display it back onto a nice dashboard for you. 

It's basically my own internal version of `webhook.site`.

## How it works

Open up the index page, and sit and wait for requests to come in. 

See data. 

Do stuff with it.  

## To Do

- Make things look nicer
- Do some more parsing on the Flask routes
